.. module:: TrajAtlas.TrajDiff

TDiff
=======
A class for differential pseudotime analysis. We referred to the method used in miloR :cite:`dannDifferentialAbundanceTesting2022` to construct neighborhoods,
 and projected these neighborhoods onto a pseudo-time axis. We used a binomial distribution model to calculate differential abundance and differential expression.
