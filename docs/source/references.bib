  abstract = {Current computational workflows for comparative analyses of single-cell datasets typically use discrete clusters as input when testing for differential abundance among experimental conditions. However, clusters do not always provide the appropriate resolution and cannot capture continuous trajectories. Here we present Milo, a scalable statistical framework that performs differential abundance testing by assigning cells to partially overlapping neighborhoods on a k-nearest neighbor graph. Using simulations and single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) data, we show that Milo can identify perturbations that are obscured by discretizing cells into clusters, that it maintains false discovery rate control across batch effects and that it outperforms alternative differential abundance testing strategies. Milo identifies the decline of a fate-biased epithelial precursor in the aging mouse thymus and identifies perturbations to multiple lineages in human cirrhotic liver. As Milo is based on a cell--cell similarity structure, it might also be applicable to single-cell data other than scRNA-seq. Milo is provided as an open-source R software package at https://github.com/MarioniLab/miloR.},

  abstract = {Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is an intuitively appealing method to extract additive combinations of measurements from noisy or complex data. NMF is applied broadly to text and image processing, time-series analysis, and genomics, where recent technological advances permit sequencing experiments to measure the representation of tens of thousands of features in millions of single cells. In these experiments, a count of zero for a given feature in a given cell may indicate either the absence of that feature or an insufficient read coverage to detect that feature (``dropout''). In contrast to spectral decompositions such as the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the strictly positive imputation of signal by NMF is an ideal fit for single-cell data with ambiguous zeroes. Nevertheless, most single-cell analysis pipelines apply SVD or Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on transformed counts because these implementations are fast while current NMF implementations are slow. To address this need, we present an accessible NMF implementation that is much faster than PCA and rivals the runtimes of state-of-the-art SVD. NMF models learned with our implementation from raw count matrices yield intuitive summaries of complex biological processes, capturing coordinated gene activity and enrichment of sample metadata. Our NMF implementation, available in the RcppML (Rcpp Machine Learning library) R package, improves upon current NMF implementations by introducing a scaling diagonal to enable convex L1 regularization for feature engineering, reproducible factor scalings, and symmetric factorizations. RcppML NMF easily handles sparse datasets with millions of samples, making NMF an attractive replacement for PCA in the analysis of single-cell experiments.},

While many methods have been developed to infer the pseudotemporal trajectories of cells within a biological sample, it remains a challenge to compare pseudotemporal patterns with multiple samples (or replicates) across different experimental conditions. Here, we introduce Lamian, a comprehensive and statistically-rigorous computational framework for differential multi-sample pseudotime analysis. Lamian can be used to identify changes in a biological process associated with sample covariates, such as different biological conditions while adjusting for batch effects, and to detect changes in gene expression, cell density, and topology of a pseudotemporal trajectory. Unlike existing methods that ignore sample variability, Lamian draws statistical inference after accounting for cross-sample variability and hence substantially reduces sample-specific false discoveries that are not generalizable to new samples. Using both real scRNA-seq~and simulation data, including an analysis of differential immune response programs between COVID-19 patients with different disease severity levels, we demonstrate the advantages of Lamian in decoding cellular gene expression programs in continuous biological processes.},

Yet learning from reference data is complicated by batch effects between datasets, limited availability of computational resources and sharing restrictions on raw data. Here we introduce a deep learning strategy for mapping query datasets on top of a reference called single-cell architectural surgery (scArches). scArches uses transfer learning and parameter optimization to enable efficient, decentralized, iterative reference building and contextualization of new datasets with existing references without sharing raw data. Using examples from mouse brain, pancreas, immune and whole-organism atlases, we show that scArches preserves biological state information while removing batch effects, despite using four orders of magnitude fewer parameters than de novo integration. scArches generalizes to multimodal reference mapping, allowing imputation of missing modalities. Finally, scArches retains coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) disease variation when mapping to a healthy reference, enabling the discovery of disease-specific cell states. scArches will facilitate collaborative projects by enabling iterative construction, updating, sharing and efficient use of reference atlases.},

  abstract = {Osteoblasts are the only cells that can give rise to bones in vertebrates. Thus, one of the most important functions of these metabolically active cells is mineralized matrix production. Because osteoblasts have a limited lifespan, they must be constantly replenished by preosteoblasts, their immediate precursors. Because disruption of the regulation of bone-forming osteoblasts results in a variety of bone diseases, a better understanding of the origin of these cells by defining the mechanisms of bone development, remodeling, and regeneration is central to the development of novel therapeutic approaches. In recent years, substantial new insights into the origin of osteoblasts---largely owing to rapid technological advances in murine lineage-tracing approaches and other single-cell technologies---have been obtained. Collectively, these findings indicate that osteoblasts involved in bone formation under various physiological, pathological, and therapeutic conditions can be obtained from numerous sources. The origins of osteoblasts include, but are not limited to, chondrocytes in the growth plate, stromal cells in the bone marrow, quiescent bone-lining cells on the bone surface, and specialized fibroblasts in the craniofacial structures, such as sutures and periodontal ligaments. Because osteoblasts can be generated from local cellular sources, bones can flexibly respond to regenerative and anabolic cues. However, whether osteoblasts derived from different cellular sources have distinct functions remains to be investigated. Currently, we are at the initial stage to aptly unravel the incredible diversity of the origins of bone-forming osteoblasts. {\copyright} 2021 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research (ASBMR).},

In such dynamic biological systems, cellular states form a continuum, e.g., for the differentiation of stem cells into mature cell types. This process is often represented via a trajectory in a reduced-dimensional representation of the scRNA-Seq dataset. While many methods have been suggested for trajectory inference, it is often unclear how to handle multiple biological groups or conditions, e.g., inferring and comparing the differentiation trajectories of wild-type and knock-out stem cell populations. In this manuscript, we present condiments, a method for the inference and downstream interpretation of cell trajectories across multiple conditions. Our framework allows the interpretation of differences between conditions at the trajectory, cell population, and gene expression levels. We start by integrating datasets from multiple conditions into a single trajectory. By comparing the cell's conditions along the trajectory's path, we can detect large-scale changes, indicative of differential progression or fate selection. We also demonstrate how to detect subtler changes by finding genes that exhibit different behaviors between these conditions along a differentiation path.},

In this manuscript, we demonstrate that our previously developed method, scVI, provides an effective and fully probabilistic approach for joint representation and analysis of scRNA-seq data, while accounting for uncertainty caused by biological and measurement noise. We also introduce single-cell ANnotation using Variational Inference (scANVI), a semi-supervised variant of scVI designed to leverage existing cell state annotations. We demonstrate that scVI and scANVI compare favorably to state-of-the-art methods for data integration and cell state annotation in terms of accuracy, scalability, and adaptability to challenging settings. In contrast to existing methods, scVI and scANVI integrate multiple datasets with a single generative model that can be directly used for downstream tasks, such as differential expression. Both methods are easily accessible through scvi-tools.},

While a variety of statistical and computational methods have been proposed for inferring cell lineages, the problem of accurately characterizing multiple branching lineages remains difficult to solve. We introduce Slingshot, a novel method for inferring cell lineages and pseudotimes from single-cell gene expression data. In previously published datasets, Slingshot correctly identifies the biological signal for one to three branching trajectories. Additionally, our simulation study shows that Slingshot infers more accurate pseudotimes than other leading methods. Slingshot is a uniquely robust and flexible tool which combines the highly stable techniques necessary for noisy single-cell data with the ability to identify multiple trajectories. Accurate lineage inference is a critical step in the identification of dynamic temporal gene expression.},

Current data analysis procedures, however, either fail to exploit the continuous resolution provided by trajectory inference, or fail to pinpoint the exact types of differential expression. We introduce tradeSeq, a powerful generalized additive model framework based on the negative binomial distribution that allows flexible inference of both within-lineage and between-lineage differential expression.

One identified subpopulation is a unique cell type that expresses adipocyte markers but contains no lipid droplets. As non-proliferative precursors for adipocytes, they exist abundantly as pericytes and stromal cells that form a ubiquitous 3D network inside the marrow cavity.

In its place, we advocate for a data-driven, tree-based nomenclature that is rooted in a ``consensus ontogeny'' spanning the life cycle of a given species. We explore how such a reference cell tree, inclusive of both lineage histories and molecular states, could be constructed, represented, and segmented in practice. Analogous to the taxonomic classification of species, a consensus ontogeny would provide a universal, stable, and extendable framework for precise scientific communication, both contemporaneously and across the ages.},

  abstract = {Bone consists of separate inner endosteal and outer periosteal compartments, each with distinct contributions to bone physiology and each maintaining separate pools of cells owing to physical separation by the bone cortex. The skeletal stem cell that gives rise to endosteal osteoblasts has been extensively studied; however, the identity of periosteal stem cells remains unclear1--5. Here we identify a periosteal stem cell (PSC) that is present in the long bones and calvarium of mice, displays clonal multipotency and self-renewal, and sits at the apex of a differentiation hierarchy. Single-cell and bulk transcriptional profiling show that PSCs display transcriptional signatures that are distinct from those of other skeletal stem cells and mature mesenchymal cells. Whereas other skeletal stem cells form bone via an initial cartilage template using the endochondral pathway4, PSCs form bone via a direct intramembranous route, providing a cellular basis for the divergence between intramembranous versus endochondral developmental pathways. However, there is plasticity in this division, as PSCs acquire endochondral bone formation capacity in response to injury. Genetic blockade of the ability of PSCs to give rise to bone-forming osteoblasts results in selective impairments in cortical bone architecture and defects in fracture healing. A cell analogous to mouse PSCs is present in the human periosteum, raising the possibility that PSCs are attractive targets for drug and cellular therapy for skeletal disorders. The identification of PSCs provides evidence that bone contains multiple pools of stem cells, each with distinct physiologic functions.},

  abstract = {Craniosynostosis is a group of disorders of premature calvarial suture fusion. The identity of the calvarial stem cells (CSCs) that produce fusion-driving osteoblasts in craniosynostosis remains poorly understood. Here we show that both physiologic calvarial mineralization and pathologic calvarial fusion in craniosynostosis reflect the interaction of two separate stem cell lineages; a previously identified cathepsin K (CTSK) lineage CSC1 (CTSK+ CSC) and a separate discoidin domain-containing receptor 2 (DDR2) lineage stem cell (DDR2+ CSC) that we identified in this study. Deletion of Twist1, a gene associated with craniosynostosis in humans2,3, solely in CTSK+ CSCs is sufficient to drive craniosynostosis in mice, but the sites that are destined to fuse exhibit an unexpected depletion of CTSK+ CSCs and a corresponding expansion of DDR2+ CSCs, with DDR2+ CSC expansion being a direct maladaptive response to CTSK+ CSC depletion. DDR2+ CSCs display full stemness features, and our results establish the presence of two distinct stem cell lineages in the sutures, with both populations contributing to physiologic calvarial mineralization. DDR2+ CSCs mediate a distinct form of endochondral ossification without the typical haematopoietic marrow formation. Implantation of DDR2+ CSCs into suture sites is sufficient to induce fusion, and this phenotype was prevented by co-transplantation of CTSK+ CSCs. Finally, the human counterparts of DDR2+ CSCs and CTSK+ CSCs display conserved functional properties in xenograft assays. The interaction between these two stem cell populations provides a new biologic interface for the modulation of calvarial mineralization and suture patency.},

However, recent work has identified that SSCs are not monolithic, with long bones, craniofacial sites, and the spine being formed by distinct stem cells. Recent studies have utilized techniques such as fluorescence-activated cell sorting, lineage tracing, and single-cell sequencing to investigate the involvement of SSCs in bone development, homeostasis, and disease. These investigations have allowed researchers to map the lineage commitment trajectory of SSCs in different parts of the body and at different time points. Furthermore, recent studies have shed light on the characteristics of SSCs in both physiological and pathological conditions. This review focuses on discussing the spatiotemporal distribution of SSCs and enhancing our understanding of the diversity and plasticity of SSCs by summarizing recent discoveries.},

We uncover a relationship between descendants of these two lineages, in which epiblast cells differentiate into endoderm at two distinct time points---before and during gastrulation. Trajectories of endoderm cells were mapped as they acquired embryonic versus extra-embryonic fates and as they spatially converged within the nascent gut endoderm, which revealed these cells to be globally similar but retain aspects of their lineage history. We observed the regionalized identity of cells along the anterior--posterior axis of the emergent gut tube, which reflects their embryonic or extra-embryonic origin, and the coordinated patterning of these cells into organ-specific territories.},

We quantified clonal divergence and convergence across all major cell classes postnatally, and found diverse types of GABAergic neuron that share a common lineage. Divergence of GABAergic clones occurred during embryogenesis upon cell-cycle exit, suggesting that differentiation into subtypes is initiated as a lineage-dependent process at the progenitor cell level.},

We tested how clonally related cells traverse this landscape by developing a transposon-based barcoding approach (``TracerSeq'') for reconstructing single-cell lineage histories. Clonally related cells were often restricted by the state landscape, including a case in which two independent lineages converge on similar fates. Cell fates remained restricted to this landscape in chordin-deficient embryos. We provide web-based resources for further analysis of the single-cell data.},

Because of limitations of classical clustering methods, numerous alternative module detection methods have been proposed, which improve upon clustering by handling co-expression in only a subset of samples, modelling the regulatory network, and/or allowing overlap between modules. In this study we use known regulatory networks to do a comprehensive and robust evaluation of these different methods. Overall, decomposition methods outperform all other strategies, while we do not find a clear advantage of biclustering and network inference-based approaches on large gene expression datasets. Using our evaluation workflow, we also investigate several practical aspects of module detection, such as parameter estimation and the use of alternative similarity measures, and conclude with recommendations for the further development of these methods.},

  abstract = {Non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) is an intuitively appealing method to extract additive combinations of measurements from noisy or complex data. NMF is applied broadly to text and image processing, time-series analysis, and genomics, where recent technological advances permit sequencing experiments to measure the representation of tens of thousands of features in millions of single cells. In these experiments, a count of zero for a given feature in a given cell may indicate either the absence of that feature or an insufficient read coverage to detect that feature (``dropout''). In contrast to spectral decompositions such as the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), the strictly positive imputation of signal by NMF is an ideal fit for single-cell data with ambiguous zeroes. Nevertheless, most single-cell analysis pipelines apply SVD or Principal Component Analysis (PCA) on transformed counts because these implementations are fast while current NMF implementations are slow. To address this need, we present an accessible NMF implementation that is much faster than PCA and rivals the runtimes of state-of-the-art SVD. NMF models learned with our implementation from raw count matrices yield intuitive summaries of complex biological processes, capturing coordinated gene activity and enrichment of sample metadata. Our NMF implementation, available in the RcppML (Rcpp Machine Learning library) R package, improves upon current NMF implementations by introducing a scaling diagonal to enable convex L1 regularization for feature engineering, reproducible factor scalings, and symmetric factorizations. RcppML NMF easily handles sparse datasets with millions of samples, making NMF an attractive replacement for PCA in the analysis of single-cell experiments.},
